# GourmApp
### A simple recipe app developed using React.js.

This repo was created as part of the final project in the Front-end module at @Trybe.
We developed an application capable of consuming the MealDB/DrinkDB with many functionalities, such as favoriting recipes, keeping track of  progress and finished recipes.
